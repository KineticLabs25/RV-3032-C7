# RV-3032-C7
Arduino library for the RV-3032-C7 RTC by Microcrystal. Modified from Andy England's RV-8803 Sparkfun library. The two chips are functionally identical, but the 3032 is newer and consumes less power. A couple distinctions between the two chips made a few commands unnecessary or nonfunctional. Everything else should work identically between the two.


-Weekday alarms are not included in the RV-3032-C7

-If using timestamps with EVI, must call "setTSOverwrite()" to ENABLE. Otherwise, the RTC will keep just the first EVI event timestamped.

-This chip has a way to gather temperature data, but I haven't implemented that yet. Feel free to!

Also I haven't modified the examples for the new libraries. Literally ctrl-F replace all "8803" with "3032" should probably work.


SparkFun Real Time Clock Module - RV-8803 (Qwiic) Arduino Library
========================================

![SparkFun Real Time Clock Module - RV-8803 (Qwiic)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/parts/1/4/9/6/8/16281-SparkFun_Real_Time_Clock_Module_-_RV-8803__Qwiic_-01.jpg)

[*SparkFun Qwiic Real Time Clock Module - RV-8803 (Qwiic) (BOB-16281)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16281)

The RV-8803 is an extremely precise, low power, highly configurable RTC. Under ideal conditions it runs at approximately 240nA with +/-3ppm per year of deviation with a temperature compensated crystal.

This library allows the user to:

* Set time using hard numbers or the BUILD_TIME from the Arduino compiler
* Read time
* Configure various aspects of the RTC including setting of alarms, interrupts, and wave outputs

Examples are included to get you started
