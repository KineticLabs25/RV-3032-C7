  This example shows how to generate a periodic interrupt signal, as well as show you how to calculate the proper set up values for your necessary time.

  Hardware Connections:
    Plug the RTC into the Qwiic port on your microcontroller or on your Qwiic shield/adapter.
    If you are using an adapter cable, here is the wire color scheme: 
    Black=GND, Red=3.3V, Blue=SDA, Yellow=SCL
    Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud

#include <SparkFun_RV8803.h>

RV8803 rtc;

long lastInterruptTime = 0;

void setup() {

  Wire.begin();

  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("Alarm from RTC Example");

  if (rtc.begin() == false) {
    Serial.println("Something went wrong, check wiring");
  }

  //To configure a periodic interrupt, we'll need to do some math to figure out how to set our registers. We are able to change how many clock ticks we want to count (0-4095), and also the length of each clock tick. (4 options: 4096 Hz, 64 Hz, 1 Hz, 1/60 Hz)
  //The time ranges covered by each freqeuncy setting are as follows
  //4096 Hz: 244.14 uS - .9998 Second;                            244.14 uS per LSB             COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_4096_HZ
  //64 Hz: 15.625 mS - 63.984 Seconds;                            15.625 mS per LSB             COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_64_HZ
  //1 Hz: 1 Second - 4095 Seconds (68 minutes 16 seconds);        1 Second per LSB              COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_1_HZ
  //1/60 Hz: 1 Minute = 4095 Minutes (68 hours 16 minutes)        1 Minute per LSB              COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_1/60_HZ
  //As an example, we'll configure a ~3.5 second interrupt. We'll choose 60 Hz as our frequency as we want something longer than 1 second, but still want enough granularity to fire an interrupt at 3.5 seconds, not 3 or 4.
  //Since the resolution for this setting is 15.625 mS per LSB, we'll convert 3.5 seconds to 3500 ms. We'll then simply divide the time we want by the resolution to get the number of clock ticks we need to wait to fire the interrupt
  //3500 / 15.625 = 224 Clock ticks
  rtc.disableAllInterrupts();
  rtc.clearAllInterruptFlags();//Clear all flags in case any interrupts have occurred.
  rtc.setCountdownTimerFrequency(COUNTDOWN_TIMER_FREQUENCY_64_HZ);
  rtc.setCountdownTimerClockTicks(224);
  rtc.enableHardwareInterrupt(TIMER_INTERRUPT);
  rtc.setCountdownTimerEnable(ENABLE); //This will start the timer on the last clock tick of the I2C transaction
  
  lastInterruptTime = millis(); //Change millis() to micros() if you end up using the 4096 Hz counter
}

void loop() {
  if(rtc.getInterruptFlag(FLAG_TIMER))
  {
    long timeSinceLastInterrupt = millis() - lastInterruptTime; //Change millis() to micros() if you end up using the 4096 Hz counter
    lastInterruptTime = millis(); //Change millis() to micros() if you end up using the 4096 Hz counter
    rtc.clearInterruptFlag(FLAG_TIMER);
    //rtc.clearAllInterruptFlags(); // This can also be used, but beware as it will clear the entire flag register
    Serial.print("Time between interrupts: ");
    Serial.print(timeSinceLastInterrupt); 
    Serial.println(" mS");
  }
}
